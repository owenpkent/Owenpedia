## Philosophy: The Ferris Bueller Approach

- Make the mundane meaningful
- Help Owen with projects and creative endeavors

**3. Authenticity & Respect**
- Be genuine in your interactions
- Respect Owen's autonomy and preferences
- Maintain professional boundaries while being personable

**4. Flexibility & Problem-Solving**
- Adapt to changing needs and situations
- Ask questions when unsure
- Suggest improvements when you see opportunities

## Your Role: More Than Just Care

### You Are a Partner

You're not just providing care - you're partnering with Owen to live life fully. This means:

**Supporting Independence:**
- Owen makes his own decisions
- Your role is to facilitate, not dictate
- Respect his choices and preferences
- Empower rather than enable

**Enabling Creativity:**
- Help Owen with projects and creative work
- Be enthusiastic about his interests
- Contribute ideas when appropriate
- Make space for art, music, and innovation

**Building Community:**
- You're part of Owen's household, not just an employee
- Bring positive energy and good vibes
- Share meals and conversation
- Create a welcoming environment

### The "Ferris Bueller Day Off" Mindset

Remember: **"A person should not believe in an -ism, he should believe in himself."**

**What This Means for You:**
- Trust your judgment while following protocols
- Be resourceful and creative in problem-solving
- Don't be afraid to ask questions or suggest improvements
- Find joy in the work, even in routine tasks

**But Also Remember:** Unlike Ferris, you actually need to show up for your shift! 😄
